American Systems Hydroponics

A.S.H. is developing next level controlled environment (hydroponic/aeroponic/geoponic) agriculture systems designed to feed the growing population of the future, in a sustainable way.

Combining a deep knowledge of plant needs and environmental variables with a tech-savvy IoT-compatible infrastructure, we can provide nutrient-dense and abundant crops, while minimizing and resource usage.

Modular, connected, and efficient, our systems use a fraction of normal commercial resource consumption, while offering higher level of growth per square foot, pesticide-free and consumer-approved produce; and a reliable and quantifiable end product.

With the world population continuing to grow, a new agricultural revolution will be necessary if we are to avoid the pitfalls and upheaval that comes with limited access to food.

That revolution is comes in many forms, one of which is controlled environment agriculture. By combining agricultural knowledge with advanced technology and environmentally controlled infrastructure, we can eliminate many of the risks and uncertainties of growing plants of any kind.
